    "The final way we define suspiscious activity is the number of different ip addresses that the user is associated with. The average user is associated with 10 different ip addresses.

The large spikes in activity coupled with the fact that many of the data science endpoints have only been accessed once suggests that there is webscraping going on. however, further data is needed to be certain of the type of activity that is happening. They could have paid for the course, but not been reclassified as a data science student. Without access to payment records, and more time.\n",
