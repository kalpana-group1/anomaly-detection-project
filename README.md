# Project Description 

We have put this notebook to answer the following email:

Email to analyst:


#### Hello,


#### I have some questions for you that I need answered before the board meeting Thursday afternoon. My questions are listed below; however, if you discover anything else important that I didn’t think to ask, please include that as well.

1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?
3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
4. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldn’t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?
5. At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?
6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
7. Which lessons are least accessed?
8. Anything else I should be aware of?


# Project Goal 

Our project goal is to answer at least five of the questions asked in this email before our deadline so that our representive will have this data avalible in a timely manner.

# Executive Summary

1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
 - Data Science frequents Fundamentals
  - Full stack - Java Script 1 

2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?


3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
For this question we assummed that "active students" means students who are currenly students and not "alumni".
This is an exploration of the students who only access the curriculm less than 10 times 

 - Students who access the curriculum less than 10 times are all from Full Stack - Java Script
 - These are students in cohorts: Voyageurs, Andromeda, Europa, Ganymede, Hyperion, Jupiter, Marco, Neptune and Oberon.
 - These two cohorts with the largest ammount of students that do not visit the curriculum as often are Andromeda and Hyperion 

4. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldn’t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?


5. At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?


6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?
- Full Stack Java- spring, javascript-i, html-css, mysql
- Full Stack PHP - Content, javascript-i, html -css, spring
- Data science- classification, fundimentals, sql, python

7. Which lessons are least accessed?


8. Anything else I should be aware of?
